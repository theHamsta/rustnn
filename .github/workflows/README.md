# GitHub Actions Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | push, pull request | Cargo.lock consistency, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo check` per feature (ONNX Runtime, TensorRT, LiteRT, CANN, CoreML on macOS, wasm32 with `webnn-runtime`), `cargo test --lib` on Linux and macOS plus the CANN mock, rustdoc with warnings denied (`make docs-api`), operator report drift check (`make docs-backend-ops-check`) with the generator's unit tests, MkDocs strict build, version check on release tags |
| `wpt-conformance.yml` | push, pull request | WPT conformance suites: ONNX Runtime and LiteRT on Linux (LiteRT non-blocking), CoreML on macOS; uploads JSON and HTML reports |
| `wpt-conformance-nightly.yml` | schedule, manual | Full WPT run with reports, then builds the documentation site with rustdoc under `/api/` and the conformance dashboard under `/wpt-conformance/`, and deploys to GitHub Pages |
| `snapshot-sync.yml` | weekly (Monday 03:00 UTC), manual | Regenerates PASS snapshots and expected-failure lists for LiteRT, ONNX Runtime and CoreML against the pinned WPT revision and opens a pull request with the diff |
| `rustnnpt-gate.yml` | pull request | Runs the external rustnnpt conformance runner against the PR's rustnn revision and enforces a minimum pass rate |
| `docs.yml` | push to `main` (docs, `mkdocs.yml`, `src/`, `Cargo.toml`, `Makefile`), pull request, manual | MkDocs strict build, rustdoc embedded under `/api/`, cached WPT report embedded, deploy to GitHub Pages from `main` |
| `docs-pr.yml` | pull request touching docs | MkDocs strict build, rustdoc build, link check, status comment on the PR |
| `publish.yml` | GitHub release, manual | fmt, clippy, tests, `cargo publish` to crates.io |

## Conventions

- The Rust version is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`; every workflow that installs Rust pins
  the same version. Bump them together (the toolchain file lists the workflows).
- `protoc` is installed in every job; `flatc` in jobs that build the `litert-runtime` feature.
- TensorRT-RTX has no GPU runner. CI compiles the backend (`cargo check -F trtx-runtime
  --all-targets`); its WPT snapshots are regenerated locally with `make wpt-sync-trtx`.
- macOS CI explicitly runs `make test-coreml-dtypes` with and without dynamic inputs.
  It also builds and tests CoreML with and without dynamic inputs using `make build-coreml`
  and `make test-coreml`. `make test-coreml-gather` also runs the focused gather bounds and
  scalar-index shape regressions; numerical checks remain strict.
- The documentation site combines four generated parts: MkDocs pages from `docs/`, the C/C++
  Doxygen reference under `/c-api/`, rustdoc from `make docs-api`, and the WPT dashboard cached
  by the nightly workflow. MkDocs runs `scripts/build_capi_docs.py` to regenerate the C header
  and embed Doxygen output. Website jobs install Doxygen and cbindgen. Test a docs change
  locally with `make ci-docs` and `make docs-api`.

## Pages deployment

GitHub Pages is configured with "GitHub Actions" as the source. `docs.yml` deploys on pushes to
`main`; the nightly workflow redeploys with fresh conformance data. If a deployment fails with a
permission error, check Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions (read and write).

The nightly saves its `reports/` directory to the Actions cache under
`wpt-conformance-pages-<os>-<run id>`; `docs.yml` and `docs-pr.yml` restore the newest entry by
the `wpt-conformance-pages-<os>-` prefix, so a docs deploy republishes the latest nightly
dashboard rather than a placeholder. Cache entries are immutable: never reuse a fixed key here,
because the save would fail on every later run and each docs deploy would republish the first
report forever. Entries that are not restored for seven days are evicted; a docs deploy then
falls back to the placeholder page until the next successful nightly run.
